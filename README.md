</div>

üìù Project Overview
Agri-Energy Connect is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between sustainable agriculture and green energy solutions in South Africa. The platform connects farmers with energy experts, facilitating knowledge sharing, resource access, and collaboration opportunities to promote sustainable farming practices and renewable energy adoption.

Who It's For
Farmers : Agricultural producers looking to manage their profiles, products, and engage with other farmers.
Employees : System administrators managing farmer accounts, product listings, and overall platform operations.
Architecture & Design Patterns
The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, leveraging ASP.NET Core for robust backend functionality and Bootstrap 5 for responsive frontend design. Entity Framework Core is used for database interactions, ensuring efficient data management.

Database Choice
We chose Microsoft SQL Server as the database due to its reliability, scalability, and seamless integration with ASP.NET Core. SQL Server provides robust features like transaction support, security, and ease of use for both development and production environments.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Features
User Authentication
Secure login and role-based access control using ASP.NET Identity.
Password hashing ensures user credentials are stored securely.
Farmer Profiles
Detailed farmer information including farm details, contact information, and location.
Farmers can manage their profiles, update personal details, and view their product listings.
Product Marketplace
Platform for farmers to showcase their sustainable agricultural products.
Employees can manage all product listings across the platform.
Responsive Design
Built with Bootstrap 5 to ensure a mobile-friendly interface.
Font icons from FontAwesome enhance usability and visual appeal.
Data Management
Entity Framework Core handles CRUD operations efficiently.
SQL Server serves as the backend database, providing reliable data storage and retrieval.
üöÄ User Roles
The platform supports two primary user roles:

Employee
